"""先吃组合: multi-item eat-first combo planning.

Pure planning layer — no DB access, no mutation. The API layer loads
on-shelf lots, calls plan_combo for preview (no writes), and calls it
again inside a BEGIN IMMEDIATE transaction for confirm (all-or-nothing).

Invariants enforced here:
- Only clean lots with positive remaining qty may enter a combo
  (dirty rows like the seeded 冻饺 never land in deductions).
- The verdict is all-or-nothing: ok only when every demand line is
  fully covered, so a confirm either writes the whole group or nothing.
